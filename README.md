### Introduction
Documentation for the *Internet of Things and Data Analytics* Master

In order to use the notebooks you need some environment that allows you loading Jupyter Notebooks for Python. If you don't already have one I suggests Anaconda


- Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). A problem with Anaconda is that it requires some space on hard disk. If you find problems you can try to install Jupyter Notebooks for Python alone (in this case you will probably need to install Python 3.7 or above separately).

In order to load a notebook:

- Download the notebook from the code folder
- Start Anaconda. 
- Select Jupyter
- Then a browser should open. 
- You can either move the notebook to the folder where the browser is showing the files, or upload the notebook
- When you already see the name of the notebook file in the browser home folder, click on it
- We are ready!
